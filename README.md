~~Sentence-based Emotion Recognition on Evolutionary Neural Networks~~ --
Evolve Complex Neural Networks for Natural Language Model
=====
# Introduction
The final project for Deep Learning course.
Original network structure is designed by [Yoon Kim](https://github.com/yoonkim/lstm-char-cnn) and Base codes are borrowed from [mkroutikov](https://github.com/mkroutikov/tf-lstm-char-cnn).

# Dataset
[Penn Treebank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc99t42)

# Toolkits
* Python 3.4.3 -> Python 2.7.6
* Tensorflow 1.0.0 -> Tensorflow 1.0.1
